# Running the RSKj Node using a CLI
> After fulfilling the steps *Pre-requisites*, *Get the source code*, *Ensure the security chain* and *Get external dependencies* according to your operating system ([Windows](/node-operators/setup/node-runner/windows), [Linux](/node-operators/setup/node-runner/linux), [Mac](/node-operators/setup/node-runner/macos)), you can compile and run a Rootstock node from command line following these steps.

## Compiling and running the node

From the root directory where the code was downloaded, execute:

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

After building, run:

```bash
java -cp [jar] co.rsk.Start
```

Replace:

- **[jar]**: the path to the fatjar generated by the gradle shadow command. It can be found on `rskj-core/build/libs/rskj-core-{version}-all.jar`.

It's ready!
