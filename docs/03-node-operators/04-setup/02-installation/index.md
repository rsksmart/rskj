# RSKj Node Installation

Rootstock nodes can be installed on Ubuntu OS, Windows, Docker and Java. Here, we provide step-by-step instructions for all supported dev environments. Depending on your network performance, it usually takes *10 to 15 mins* to setup a working node on Mainnet.

> Ensure that your system meets the [minimum requirements](/node-operators/setup/requirements/) before installing the Rootstock nodes.

> Looking to test your dApps on testnet in minutes before deploying to mainnet? Use the [RPC API](/developers/rpc-api/)
