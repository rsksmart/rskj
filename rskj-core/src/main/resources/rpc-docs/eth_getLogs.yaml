      **Object** - The filter options:
      - **fromBlock**: **QUANTITY|TAG** - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.
      - **toBlock**: **QUANTITY|TAG** - (optional, default: "latest") Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.
      - **address**: **DATA|Array**, 20 Bytes - (optional) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
      - **topics**: **Array of DATA**, - (optional) Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of DATA with “or” options.
      - **blockhash**: **DATA**, 32 Bytes - (optional) With the addition of EIP-234 (Geth >= v1.8.13 or Parity >= v2.1.0), blockHash is a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock are allowed.

      **Array** - Array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll.

      - For filters created with eth_newBlockFilter the return are block hashes (DATA, 32 Bytes), e.g. ["0x3454645634534..."].
      - For filters created with eth_newPendingTransactionFilter the return are transaction hashes (DATA, 32 Bytes), e.g. ["0x6345343454645..."].
      - For filters created with eth_newFilter logs are objects with following params:
        - removed: **TAG** - true when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. false if its a valid log.
        - logIndex: **QUANTITY** - integer of the log index position in the block. null when its pending log.
        - transactionIndex: **QUANTITY** - integer of the transactions index position log was created from. null when its pending log.
        - transactionHash: **DATA**, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was created from. null when its pending log.
        - blockHash: **DATA**, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. null when its pending. null when its pending log.
        - blockNumber: **QUANTITY** - the block number where this log was in. null when its pending. null when its pending log.
        - address: **DATA**, 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
        - data: **DATA** - contains the non-indexed arguments of the log.
        - topics: **Array of DATA** - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes DATA of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)
