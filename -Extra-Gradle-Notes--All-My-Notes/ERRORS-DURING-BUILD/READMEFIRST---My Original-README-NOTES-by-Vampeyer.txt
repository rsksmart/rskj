Installation notes by Vampeyer  . 

----------------------------------------
1. Build the project using Gradle:
Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:

./gradlew build
(On Windows, use gradlew.bat build instead) This will 
compile your 
code and create the necessary artifacts (like JAR files).  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...... My gradlew.bat file and my  ./gradlew build command both threw the same exception error 
on my windows machine. 


C:\Users\vampeyer\Desktop\HACKATHON-IN-48HRSD-OR-LESS\rootstock ----NOdes\rskj>gradlew.bat
Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
....... I was going to build a simple node application for windows mac and android , 
but it would seem that this is a more critical use need for rootstack. 

- Without a easily reproducible code base for nodes , we are left without a source of truth 
for further building and extensive developing. 

---- Lets be frank , with ourselves , without a working , 
- easily compilable 
- easiy buildable , 
- easily raplicatable process , the entire thing is difficult , and that is a key 
core neccesary feature for further adoption of the technology. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



- So , I will be carefully documenting these major breaks in a folder called ,  
ERRORS-DURING-BUILD   ,  along with some images to support the break fix request  that is ,  
---- required , to move forward  ,  we have to be able to build on our machines !

Dear rootstock devs  , also 

We cannot afford intelli - J so please dont make too officail documentaion around its functionality , 
as it is a pricaey one ! 

Please release more basic IDE developing practices.
