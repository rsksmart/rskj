To develop in this reposirory , 

simply make your changes and then run the same commands as before 



* ./gradlew build  


commands , will build in the 

* app/build/libs/app.jar file , and you should delete the build folder , 
before each build , as running the 

*gradle build  

command , will generate simply a new build folder and its needed 
contents.

Delete it and rebuild whenever you made edits , and need another production build .jar app.
